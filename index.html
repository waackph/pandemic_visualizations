                            This small exploratory data visualization project is only for experimenting with different data sets
                            and trying out different forms of data visualization and interactive features.
                            The plots are drawn with the javascript library <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and the styling is made using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.
                            The data analysis addessses the question of if and how the change of the dominant covid-19 variant can be observed in the amount of covid-19 infections in Germany.
                            The data set this analysis is based on is a processed version of the RKI data set of <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Testzahl.html">SARS-CoV-2-Testzahlen</a>
                            and the <a href="https://www.corona-daten-deutschland.de/dataset/hospitalisierung#">Hospitalization</a>.
                            The dominant variant for this analysis is simply defined by the SARS-CoV-2 variant that is responsible for the most covid-19 infections. The information is derived from a <a href="https://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/corona-virus-varianten-ueberblick-100.html">visualization</a> of a WDR article.

                            At first we are going to look into the proportion of positive cases in relation to overall tests carried out.
                            Generally, we see the summer valleys for 2020 and 2021. People are more outside, hence there is less risk for infections.
                            Moreover, there are the impacts of the anit-corona measures such as the lockdown reducing the infections. 
                            Noticeable is also the big increase of positive tests starting latest with the year 2022.

                            Differentiating the time frames a variant (Original, Alpha. Delta, Omikron) is dominant
                            shows especially the early increase of positive tests in the second half of 2021 (Delta)
                            and the strong increase due to Omikron in 2022. Comparing the progression of positive cases
                            in calender weeks, it is noticeable how the development is relatively similar for the seasons 
                            regarding the Original, Alpha and Delta variant. 
                            While Omikron on the other hand, the positive tests increase and are generally way higher
                            even at the beginning of summer. This may be partly explained by the less strict anti-corona measures in Germany.

                        <p>
                            In comparison to the positive cases it is most noticeable that in the time when the Omikron variant was dominant
                            the most positive cases are present, but at the same time there are way fewer cases of hospizalization in relation to the positive cases.
                            Notice, though, that the amount of tests carried out likely explains part of the big deviation. It can be also seen in the original form of covid-19.
                            Here, at the beginning not so many tests where carried out, the reporting was not as well, 
                            while maybe the reporting of hospitalization has been better right from the start, because it is an information reported more regularly.
                            But still, also the length of hospital visit related to the covid-19 infection may take part in the deviation. 
                            Hence, the Omikron variant is obviously dangerous because of the infectivity, but does not so often lead to a hospitalization.
